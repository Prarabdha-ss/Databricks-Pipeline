Databricks Pipeline

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a data pipeline using Databricks. The pipeline integrates multiple data sources, processes large datasets efficiently using PySpark, and ensures data quality and governance with Delta Lake and Unity Catalog.

Features

Data Ingestion: Fetches data from Azure Blob Storage, ADLS, and other sources.

Data Processing: Uses PySpark for transformation, aggregation, and cleansing.

Delta Lake: Ensures ACID transactions and data versioning.

Unity Catalog: Implements fine-grained access control and governance.

Automation: Leverages Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring workflows.

Real-time Processing: Implements Delta Live Pipelines for near real-time data updates.

Optimization: Uses Databricks Runtime tuning for cost and performance efficiency.

Architecture

Data Sources: Azure Blob Storage, ADLS, relational/non-relational databases.

Ingestion Layer: Auto Loader for streaming and batch ingestion.

Processing Layer: PySpark transformations, Delta Lake storage.

Governance Layer: Unity Catalog for access control and compliance.

Orchestration: Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring.

Serving Layer: Optimized queries for analytics and reporting.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Databricks workspace with Unity Catalog enabled.

Azure Blob Storage / ADLS for data storage.

Apache Airflow setup (if using orchestration).

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Prarabdha-ss/Databricks-Pipeline.git
cd Databricks-Pipeline

Configure Databricks CLI for authentication:

databricks configure --profile <profile-name>

Deploy Databricks Asset Bundles (if applicable):

databricks bundle deploy

Run the pipeline notebooks in Databricks workspace.

Schedule workflows using Apache Airflow or Databricks Workflows.
